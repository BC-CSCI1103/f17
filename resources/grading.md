# CSCI 1103 Computer Science I Honors

### Fall 2017

## Grading

CS1103 is very much a "learn by doing" course. Reflecting this, grades will emphasize the problem sets. Grades will be computed along the following lines: 
- 50% problem sets;
- 38% three exams (10%, 10%, 18%);
- 12% class, lab and piazza forum participation.

**Notes**:    
- The instructor reserves the right to adjust the relative percentages of the grade components for an individual student if there is a significant discrepancy between the exam scores and the problem set scores.

- Unless specified otherwise, problem sets must be submitted for grading by midnight on the specified due date.

- Extensions for problem set deadlines are granted only for documented medical problems or other family emergencies. Having a busy schedule isn't grounds for an extension.

- Under no circumstances can code be submitted for grading by attaching it to an email message. An attempt to submit code via email will not receive a reply notifying the sender that the attempted submission failed.

- Late problem sets will be penalized 25% each day.

- Students missing an exam without prior permission of the instructor will need a note from their doctor.

- Any violation of [the university's policy on academic integrity](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/polisci/integrity.html) will result in a failing grade for the course.
