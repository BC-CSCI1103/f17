# CSCI 1103 Computer Science I Honors

### Fall 2017

## About


CS1103 is the Honors introductory course in Computer Science.  CS1103 teaches coding using the [OCaml](http://ocaml.org) dialect of the [ML programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)). By the end of the course you should be able to design fairly complex programs that do interesting and useful things.

Although almost all of the work you do for the course involves coding, the subject is wider than just the writing of programs, much less programs in any particular programming language. You will learn something about the particular approach Computer Science takes to representing and manipulating information, and to solving problems.

### Methods

CS1103 is an immersion course, we'll be learning about computation by immersing ourselves in OCaml code. The first order of business is to learn how to code. By way of demonstration, we'll be covering a lot 
of OCaml code in class.  Our starting point will be familiar to anyone experienced with basic high-school algebra. Using this as our foundation, we'll introduce new programming concepts and constructs, step by step, until we've covered most of the tools available to programmers developing small-scale programs (involving what are called *procedural abstractions*). Our first programs will have between say 10 and 20 lines of code. By the end of the semester we'll be able to manage programs with a few hundred lines of code.

Like playing a musical instrument, coding is a skill that can only be developed with practice. Learning to code is hard work but, as you'll find, getting a piece of software to work is extremely satisfying.

CS1103 consists of two weekly 75 minute lectures and one weekly 60 minute lab. There will be weekly problem sets, all of which require the development of OCaml code. Some problem sets will involve hand-written work and diagrams.

**CS1103 Computer Science I Honors, meets TR, 3PM - 4:15PM in Fulton Hall 415.**

### Screens When and Where

CS1103 will have screen-less classrooms.  **This means that no open laptops, tablets, or smart-phones will be allowed.** All lecture notes and sample programs will be posted to the course website. If you have special circumstances that require you to bring a screen to class, please see me.

Unlike lecture, students are **required to bring their laptops to every lab**. If you do not own a laptop please see me.
